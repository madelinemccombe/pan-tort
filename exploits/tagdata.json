Microsoft strongly discourages the use of this setting.\n\nIf the AlwaysInstallElevated value is not set to \"1\" under both of the preceding registry keys, the installer uses elevated privileges to install managed applications and uses the current user's privilege level for unmanaged applications.\nBecause this policy permits users to install applications that require access to directories and registry keys for which the user may not have permission to view or change, you should consider whether it provides your users with an appropriate level of security. Setting this policy directs Windows Installer to use system permissions when it installs the application on the system. If this policy is not set, applications not distributed by the administrator are installed using the user's privileges and only managed applications get elevated privileges.\nNote that once the per-machine policy for AlwaysInstallElevated is enabled, any user can set their per-user setting.",

A significant number of the targets of the group are connected to Qatar\u2019s domestic and international politics, drawing recurring parallels to previous campaigns and suggesting a partial connection to the country. Few state interests would convincingly account why someone would engage in espionage against Egyptian lawyers at the same time as Iranian reformists, leaving open the possibility that the operator is a non-state actor with diverse motivations. Still, the operation\u2019s ambitious attempts against Arab foreign ministers and civil society, and dozens of others, warrants special interest. These incidents also reflect current tensions among Gulf states, undergirding the ubiquitous and central role of cyber espionage in Middle Eastern statecraft.",

The malware family contains functionality for keylogging, creating and killing processes, performing filesystem and registry modifications, spawning interactive command shells, performing process injection, logging off the current user or shutting down the local machine.  In addition, the malware also implements a custom VNC like protocol which sends screenshots of the desktop to the C2 server and accepts keyboard and mouse input.  The malware communicates to its C2 servers using SSL, with self signed SSL certificates.  The malware family will create a copy of cmd.exe to perform its C2 activity, and replace the \"Microsoft corp\" strings in the cmd.exe binary with different values.  The malware family typically maintains persistence through installing itself as a service.",

Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this campaign, which used the ELIRKS backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It is known for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an attacker to change the C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.\n\nLike most campaigns, BLACKGEAR has evolved over time. Research indicates that it has started targeting Japanese users as the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using blogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&C activity.\n\nIt appears as though the BLACKGEAR campaign as reported by TrendMicro might reference the activity of several distinct threat actors.",

Many versions of Bucbi include a decryption function within the malware, which may be of use in decrypting files. ",

The malware used in this campaign is a mix of off-the-shelf tools, NSIS-packed malware and bespoke spyware that abuses Yandex\u2019s Punto software, a program for Russian users which silently and automatically changes the keyboard language depending on what the user is typing. In cases analysed by ESET, once the cybercriminals have compromised a computer, they use custom tools to analyze its content, install a backdoor and finally deploy a malicious module that spies on the system and can enumerate smart cards.\n\nThe campaign targets a wide range of Russian banks, used several different code signing certificates and implements evasive methods to avoid detection. As explained later, we believe this campaign is financially-motivated and that it targets accounting departments in Russian businesses. Operation Buhtrap is a mix of two words: \u201cBuhgalter\u201d and \u201ctrap\u201d. \u201cBuhgalter\u201d means \u201caccountant\u201d in Russian.\n\nSince its initial identification, this campaign continues to this day, and primarily targets Russian and Eastern European users.",

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.",

Among its technical innovations, there is a custom file system to execute commands in a stealthy fashion, and a complex task-scheduling module working in a similar way to the \u201ccron\u201d Unix command. Interestingly, the binary contains a lot of verbose error messages, allowing us to see Dino\u2019s developers\u2019 choice of wording. Also, a few technical artefacts suggest that Dino was authored by native French speakers.",

When some software tries to change system-related parts of the Registry or the file system, Windows shows a UAC confirmation dialog, where the user should confirm if he really wants to make those changes. Thus, UAC provides a special security environment for your user account with limited access rights and can elevate a particular process to full access rights when necessary.  Malware often disables UAC to prevent the confirmation dialogs so that it can install malicious software covertly.",

This allows Duuzer to attempt to evade detection from security researchers who are running virtual machines that are designed to be compromised with malware for analysis.\n\nOnce Duuzer infects a computer, it opens a back door, giving the attackers access to almost everything. The attackers can securely connect to the compromised computer through the threat and perform the following activities:\n\nGather system and drive information\nCreate, enumerate, and end processes\nAccess, modify, and delete files\nUpload and download files\nChange the time attributes of files\nExecute commands",

      "description": "Cisco Talos recently observed a targeted malware campaign being leveraged in an attempt to compromise specific organizations. The infection vector associated with this campaign was a Microsoft Word document that was disguised as a job posting for Cisco Korea, and leveraged legitimate content available as part of job postings on various websites. EST Security also described this campaign in a blog post this week. This malicious Office document appears to have been the initial portion of what was designed to be a multi-stage infection process.\n\nDuring analysis of this campaign, Cisco located additional samples that they believe are linked to multiple previous campaigns associated with the same threat actor. Each of the campaigns leveraged malicious documents and initial stage payloads that all featured similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Due to the targeted nature of this campaign, the lack of widespread indicator of compromise data, and the apparent nature of the targeting, this appears to be associated with a sophisticated attacker. This sort of attack has become more common as threat actors continue to target users to gain an initial foothold in environments. Organizations are encouraged to employ a defense-in-depth approach to security and disallow the execution of macros where possible.\n\nThis campaign has links to the BlockBuster Sequel campaign.",

The group then offers evidence of its theft on public websites and demands a ransom from victims. If payment is not forthcoming, the threat actors claim, the data will be released publicly and, further, they threaten to destroy the data and disrupt business operations.\nThe actor, or group, has been active since 2013, the researchers said, and continue their activity, primarily attacking casinos and mining operations, mainly in Canada. \"In some cases, when the extortion demand was not met, the attacker(s) destroyed production Windows systems by deleting critical operating system files and then shutting down the impacted systems,\".\nThe campaigns have primarily used specially crafted spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain entry into corporate networks, duping unsuspecting workers to click on a link directing them to a server maintained by FIN10. The group likely used LinkedIn and other social media to gather specific details it then used in crafting its messages.",

The commands include instructing the malware to download and execute files, start processes, shutdown and reboot the system, and steal cookies and local passwords.\n\nOne of the malware's most interesting features is that it reads Windows\u2019 ntdll.dll module from disk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and API monitoring mechanisms ineffective. The malware author calls this technique \"Lagos Island method\" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name). \n\nIt also features a persistence method that randomly changes the path, filename, file extension, and the registry key used for persistence. \n\nThe malware author does not sell the builder, but only sells the panel, and then generates the executable files as a service.",

The threat actor leveraged the CVE-2017-0199 Microsoft Word Office/WordPad Remote Code Execution Vulnerability with carefully crafted decoy content customized for each target recipient. Our research showed that the spear phishing emails came from multiple compromised email accounts tied to a legitimate domain in North East Asia. We believe that the threat actor hijacked an existing, legitimate in-progress conversation and posed as the legitimate senders to send malicious spear phishing emails to the recipients.\n\nUpon successful exploitation, the malicious document delivered two malware payloads PoohMilk and Freenki.\n\nThe targeted victims in this campaign we identified include:\n - a bank based in the Middle East\n - trademark and intellectual property service companies based in Europe\n - an international sporting organisation\n - individuals with indirect ties to a country in North East Asia\n\nIn past activity that we believe is linked to this same threat actor, dissidents and others were also likely targeted.

The Globe Ransomware is no exception with malware developers basing their ransomware on the popular Purge movies. With a Purge based based wallpaper and adding the .purge extension to encrypted files, the malware developer was clearly inspired by the movies.\n\nDiscovered by Emsisoft security researcher xXToffeeXx, the Globe Ransomware acts just like other ransomware. It will encrypt a victim's files and then display a ransom note. Unlike most other ransomware, though, Globe uses the Blowfish encryption algorithm rather the commonly used AES encryption. Furthermore, instead of a text and html ransom note, the Globe Ransomware uses a HTA, or HTML Application, file to display the ransom note.",

By having multiple exploits to use, Godless can target virtually any Android device running on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or earlier. \n\nGodless is reminiscent of an exploit kit, in that it uses an open-source rooting framework called android-rooting-tools. The said framework has various exploits in its arsenal that can be used to root various Android-based devices. The two most prominent vulnerabilities targeted by this kit are CVE-2015-3636 (used by the PingPongRoot exploit) and CVE-2014-3153 (used by the Towelroot exploit).  The remaining exploits are deprecated and relatively unknown even in the security community.",

Originally, these malicious applications obtained unauthorized super-user privileges to install legitimate apps and display advertising. Now these same advertising botnets, Leech, Ztorg and Gorpo, are installing Triada too.\n\nTriada contains modular functionality and after getting into a user\u2019s device, it injects itself in nearly every working process and continues to exist in memory. Triada uses the Zygote system process to inject itself into other system processes. Since Zygote\u2019s purpose is to launch Android applications, Triada becomes part of any launched application by Zygote and can, in turn, modify the application\u2019s operation to any desired outcome by the malware authors. All of the running Trojan processes are hidden from the user and other applications. As a result, it is difficult for both the user and antivirus solutions to detect and remove Triada.",

Specifically, the only known infection vector for HammerDuke is to be downloaded and executed by CozyDuke onto a victim that has already been compromised by that toolset. This, together with HammerDuke\u2019s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the Dukes group as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after CozyDuke performed the initial infection and stole any readily available information from them.\nHammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because of its occasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants only contain a hardcoded C&C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other HammerDuke variants will first use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based on the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that account with links to image files that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute.",

Recently, FireEye mobile security researchers have discovered such a malware that pretends to be a \u201cGoogle Service Framework\u201d and kills an anti-virus application as well as takes other malicious actions.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen Android malware that execute privacy leakage, banking credential theft, or remote access separately, but this sample takes Android malware to a new level by combining all of those activities into one app. In addition, we found the hacker has designed a framework to conduct bank hijacking and is actively developing towards this goal. We suspect in the near future there will be a batch of bank hijacking malware once the framework is completed. Right now, eight Korean banks are recognized by the attacker, yet the hacker can quickly expand to new banks with just 30 minutes of work.",

      "description": "The 2016 attack on Ukraine\u2019s power grid that deprived part of its capital, Kiev, of power for an hour was caused by a cyberattack. ESET researchers have since analyzed samples of malware, detected by ESET as Win32/Industroyer, capable of performing exactly that type of attack.\n\nIndustroyer is a particularly dangerous threat, since it is capable of controlling electricity substation switches and circuit breakers directly. To do so, it uses industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).\n\nIndustroyer\u2019s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their communication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the attackers didn\u2019t need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach the malware \u201cto speak\u201d those protocols.",

The IRONGATE samples stood out based on their references to SCADA and associated functionality. Two samples of the malware payload were uploaded by different sources in 2014, but none of the antivirus vendors featured on VirusTotal flagged them as malicious.\n\nSiemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and determined that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products. We are unable to associate IRONGATE with any campaigns or threat actors. We acknowledge that IRONGATE could be a test case, proof of concept, or research activity for ICS attack techniques.\n\nOur analysis finds that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet, but in a simulation environment. Because the body of industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) malware is limited, we are sharing details with the broader community.\"",

This file continually monitors the running processes on the victim system, and will spawn a new instance of JackPOS if it discovered to not be running. JackPOS also has rudimentary command and control characteristics, including the ability to update itself, terminate itself, or execute a file on the victim system.\n",

These organizations appeared on a list of customers still displayed on the formerly subverted software vendor\u2019s website.\nNearly two years after the Kingslayer campaign was initiated, we still do not know how many of the customers listed on the website may have been breached, or possibly are still compromised, by the Kingslayer perpetrators.",

      "description": "The online game industry in South Korea has been a favorite target for hackers - apparently operating out of China - for quite some time. In the period from at least beginning of 2010 a number of groups attacked and managed to compromise several large game producers. We know this not only because the affected companies admitted it, but also because the attackers stole code signing certificates belonging to the victims. These certificates were then used to sign new malware - malware that eventually found its way into the hands of malware researchers.\n\nThese attacks could also intersect with other non-game related attacks. For example, a certificate belonging to the game producer YNK was used to sign malware that was later used to break into SK Communications in Korea; an intrusion that compromised the credentials of up to 35 million users. Likewise, a certificate belonging to the game producer Gala Lab was attached to PlugX malware. This PlugX was found inside malicious archives signed with certificates stolen from the office suite developer Hancom in 2012.\n\nWe recently came across another attack campaign apparently using a related modus operandi \u2013 sending malicious apparent CV\u2019s to gaming companies. This type of attack has been ongoing from ca. 2011 until spring 2014.",

      "description": "Talos has investigated a targeted malware campaign against South Korean users. The campaign was active between November 2016 and January 2017, targeting a limited number of people. The infection vector is a Hangul Word Processor document (HWP), a popular alternative to Microsoft Office for South Korean users developed by Hancom.\n\nThe malicious document in question is written in Korean with the following title:\n\n5170101-17\ub144_\ubd81\ud55c_\uc2e0\ub144\uc0ac_\ubd84\uc11d.hwp (translation: 5170101-17 __ North Korea _ New Year _ analysis .hwp)\tThis document was alleged to be written by the Korean Ministry of Unification and included their logo as a footer on the document.\n\nAn interesting twist also came within the analysed malicious document as it attempts to download a file from an official Korean government website: kgls.or.kr (Korean Government Legal Service). The file downloaded is a binary masquerading as a jpeg file that is later executed as part of the infection. It's likely that the website was compromised by the attackers to try and legitimise the HTTP GET attempts for the final payload, this traffic would potentially not have looked unfamiliar for any system administrators.\n\nThe attackers' infrastructure appeared to be up for a few days at a time with no observed infrastructure re-use occurring. Unfortunately, the compromised sites were all either cleaned or removed by the attackers and Talos were unable to obtain the final payload. This level of operational security is common for sophisticated attackers. \n\nDue to these elements it's likely that this loader has been designed by a well-funded group in order to target public sector entities in South Korea. Many of these techniques fit the profile of campaigns previously associated with attacks by certain government groups.",

Also, the analysis of the incident led to the discovery of multiple malwares targeting Android and Windows machines. Libyan Scorpions threat actors used a set of methods to hide and operate their malwares. They appear not to have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don't need to be sophisticated in order to be effective.",

      "description": " Meek is a publicly available obfuscation plugin for TOR and an implementation of the domain fronting technique. To hide TOR traffic, meek takes advantage of the way that Google and other Internet content delivery networks (CDNs) route traffic. CDNs often route traffic from IP addresses associated with one service to servers associated with another service hosted on the same network. By hosting a meek reflection server in one of these CDNs, meek can hide TOR traffic in legitimate HTTPS connections to well-known services.\n\nMeek obfuscates traffic in several stages. First, it encodes TOR traffic into HTTP specifying the host name of the reflection server (for example, the default server meek-reflect.appspot.com). It then wraps that HTTP traffic in a legitimate TLS connection to a server hosted in the same CDN cloud as the reflection server (in this example, Google). When the CDN server receives the connection, it decrypts the TLS traffic, identifies the hostname specified in the HTTP header and redirects the traffic to the reflection server. The reflection server then reconstructs the original TOR traffic from the HTTP stream and sends the traffic to the TOR network, which routes it to its destination. This process creates an outbound network connection that appears to contain normal HTTPS POST requests for google.com on a Google-owned IP address, while discretely passing the traffic through the reflection server to the TOR network. Meek can also use the TLS service and cipher suites used by Firefox to further obfuscate traffic. Differentiating this traffic from legitimate connections is extremely difficult, and encryption of both on the initial TLS connection and the TOR traffic makes meaningful analysis of the traffic impossible.

The cryptographic design is mostly solid - the files are encrypted using a run-time generated AES-256 key, however the initialization of this AES key is done with a default (null) IV.  After use, this AES key is obfuscated slightly before being encrypted using an RSA public key which is imported from a base64 string hardcoded into the binary. This newly encrypted key is then finally base64 encoded and displayed to the user in order for it to be transmitted to the malware author via public note during the Bitcoin payment.  We will refer to this final base64 encoded key material as MK.",

Once sure the computer is not a VM, it extracts, runs and adds persistency to DustySky Core. It extracts basic information about the operating system and checks for the existence of an Antivirus. It also extracts and opens the lure document.\nThe dropper's resources are two components that are dropped at run time. One is the lure document (internally called \u201cnews\u201d), which is presented to the victim once the dropper is executed. \n\nDustySky core:\nDustySky Core is a Trojan backdoor and the main component of the malware. It communicates with the command and control server, exfiltrates collected data, information and files, and receives and executes commands. It has the following capabilities:\n- Collecting information about the OS version, running processes and installed software.\n- Searching for removable media and network drives, and duplicating itself into them.\n- Extracting other components (such as the keylogging component) or receiving them from the command and control server, and running or removing them.\n- Evading virtual machines.\n- Turning the computer off or restarting it.\n- Making sure only a single instance of the malware is running",

Oilrig often utilizes numerous spear-phishing attacks using weaponized Microsoft Excel spreadsheets tracked as \u201cClayslide\u201d. Additional malware and/or tools typically used by Oilrig include \"ISMInjector\", \"RGDoor\", and \"ALMACommunicator\". Oilrig has shown preference for attacking supply chains, and often leverages the trust relationship between organizations, contractors, employees, and suppliers.\n\nSome of Oilrig's more noteworthy attacks include a spear phishing campaign leveraging fake VPN portals and compromised email accounts from IT vendors. Also, in early 2017, Oilrig was responsible for a campaign targeting a prestigious university in the United Kingdom. Earlier in 2016 Oilrig employed several varied attack methodologies targeting an adviser to the Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations, a staffer at the Turkish embassy staff in Riga, Latvia, and another official based in Turkey.\n\nThe Oilrig Group has been active at least since 2015 and continues to be so, including continuing to set up new infrastructure.",

Oldrea acts as a back door for the attackers on to the victim's computer, allowing them to extract data and install further malware.\n\nOldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some indication of the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group.\n\nOnce installed on a victim's computer, Oldrea gathers system information, along with lists of files, programs installed, and root of available drives. It will also extract data from the computer's Outlook address book and VPN configuration files. This data is then written to a temporary file in an encrypted format before being sent to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server controlled by the attackers.",

      "description": "Together with IssueMakersLab, Trend Micro uncovered Operation Red Signature, an information theft-driven supply chain attack targeting organizations in South Korea. \n\nThe threat actors compromised the update server of a remote support solutions provider to deliver a remote access tool called 9002 RAT to their targets of interest through the update process. They carried this out by first stealing the company\u2019s certificate then using it to sign the malware. They also configured the update server to only deliver malicious files if the client is located in the range of IP addresses of their target organizations.\n\n9002 RAT also installed additional malicious tools: an exploit tool for Internet Information Services (IIS) 6 WebDav (exploiting CVE-2017-7269) and an SQL database password dumper. These tools hint at how the attackers are also after data stored in their target\u2019s web server and database.",

The APT, dubbed Pacifier makes use of malicious .doc documents and .zip files distributed via spear phishing e-mail. Documents used range from curriculum vitae, to invitations to social functions or conferences, to second hand car offers and even, in one case, a letter of instructions from a high-ranking official. Some were marked as \"urgent\", \"important\", \"immediate action required\" and so on.\nOther samples of the same malicious software were detected in Iran, India, Philippines, Russia, Lithuania, Thailand, Vietnam and Hungary. The high number of variants, in conjunction with the low number of reports and the nature of the affected machines has brought us to the conclusion that we are dealing with an APT.\nThe malicious payloads delivered evolved over time, becoming stealthier and adding functionality as time went by. Our analysis focuses on three representative variants of the malware used in the attacks, but a number of others, differing by minor details, were found in the wild.",

      "description": "Ploutus is one of the most advanced ATM malware families discovered in the last few years. Discovered for the first time in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus enabled criminals to empty ATMs using either an external keyboard attached to the machine or via SMS message, a technique that had never been seen before.\n\nFireEye Labs recently identified a previously unobserved version of Ploutus, dubbed Ploutus-D, that interacts with KAL\u2019s Kalignite multivendor ATM platform. The samples we identified target the ATM vendor Diebold. However, minimal code change to Ploutus-D would greatly expand its ATM vendor targets since Kalignite Platform runs on 40 different ATM vendors in 80 countries.\n\nOnce deployed to an ATM, Ploutus-D makes it possible for a money mule to obtain thousands of dollars in minutes. A money mule must have a master key to open the top portion of the ATM (or be able to pick it), a physical keyboard to connect to the machine, and an activation code (provided by the boss in charge of the operation) in order to dispense money from the ATM. While there are some risks of the money mule being caught by cameras, the speed in which the operation is carried out minimizes the mule\u2019s risk.",

Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459 . This same attacker is also reported to have targeted various military installations in Central Asia in the past [1].

While certain characteristics of polymorphic malware change, its functional purpose remains the same. For example, a polymorphic virus will continue to spread and infect devices even if its signature changes to avoid detection. By changing characteristics to generate a new signature, signature-based detection solutions will not recognize the file as malicious. Even if the new signature is identified and added to antivirus solutions\u2019 signature database, polymorphic malware can continue to change signatures and carry out attacks without being detected.",

Functionality-wise, there is little difference between Pro PoS and Alina Spark, other than some minor cosmetic changes. Pro PoS has the ability to both exfiltrate discovered data, and receive commands from a remote server.

Once executed, the backdoor connects to specific sites and can perform several routines, which include enumerating files and directories, downloading, executing, and uploading files, and updating itself and its configuration.\n\nWorth noting among its backdoor routine is its ability to get installer properties from Uninstall Registry Key entries. It does this to get hold of information about the installed applications in the affected system, as well as to know how to uninstall certain applications. This can be handy in silently uninstalling applications, which may interfere with the backdoor\u2019s routine, e.g. anti-malware software and the likes.\n\nAnother interesting feature of this backdoor is the communication method it uses, specifically SSL. This use of SSL has a two-fold advantage: it guarantees that communication between the C&C and infected system is encrypted, at the same time it blends in with normal traffic.",

      "description": "In December 2015, employees from several Russian banks were targeted with spoofed emails, a common technique in attack campaigns. The emails were made to look like they were from the Central Bank of Russia and offered employment to their recipients. Instead of being an actual employment offer, the emails were an attempt to deliver Trojan.Ratopak onto the target\u2019s computer.\n\nTrojan.Ratopak was likely used because it can allow the attacker to gain control of the compromised computer and steal information. The threat can open a back door on the computer and allow the attacker to perform a variety of actions, including logging keystrokes, retrieving clipboard data, and viewing and controlling the screen. It can also be used to download other malicious files and tools. The narrow focus of the attacks and the use of Ratopak could be a hint to what the attackers were after.\n",

SamSa will encrypt files using a provided RSA public key and demand either a large sum of Bitcoin in exchange for the recovery key to all victimized machines, or a small bitcoin fee per infected machine.",

The Sanction Ransomware uses an AES algorithm to encrypt the victim's files and changes the extension of every file the Sanction Ransomware encrypts. Like other encryption ransomware infections, the Sanction Ransomware demands the payment of a ransom to provide the decryption key. PC security researchers strongly advise against paying the Sanction Ransomware ransom unless there is no other choice. Computer users have no way to be sure that the people responsible for the Sanction Ransomware will restore the encrypted files once the ransom is paid. Furthermore, paying the Sanction Ransomware ransom enables the creators of the Sanction Ransomware to continue producing and distributing threats. As long as encryption ransomware remains financially viable because computer users fail to back up their files and agree to pay the ransoms included in these threats, additional infections like the Sanction Ransomware will continue to appear.

Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings. \n\nKaspersky Labs uses the codename \"ProjectSauron\" to describe the Strider APT: it comprises a top-of-the-top modular cyber-espionage platform in terms of technical sophistication, designed to enable long-term campaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods. Technical details show how attackers learned from other extremely advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their mistakes.

This means that when an application allocates file space or virtual memory it is unable to view data that was previously stored in the resources Windows NT/2K allocates for it. Windows NT zero-fills memory and zeroes the sectors on disk where a file is placed before it presents either type of resource to an application. However, object reuse does not dictate that the space that a file occupies before it is deleted be zeroed. This is because Windows NT/2K is designed with the assumption that the operating system controls access to system resources. However, when the operating system is not active it is possible to use raw disk editors and recovery tools to view and recover data that the operating system has deallocated. Even when you encrypt files with Win2K's Encrypting File System (EFS), a file's original unencrypted file data is left on the disk after a new encrypted version of the file is created.",

After setting the service\u2019s status as SERVICE_RUNNING, the ServiceMain function can wait on an event instead of returning. Controls are received in a different thread. When the service is to stop, it signals the event that ServiceMain is waiting on. When ServiceMain returns, SVCHOST can unload the DLL. Though this technique is inferior, if only for making the system maintain a thread unnecessarily, it is relied on by many of Microsoft\u2019s service DLLs even as late as Windows Vista. Examples are as varied as BROWSER.DLL, CSCSVC.DLL, IISW3ADM.DLL and SHSVCS.DLL. \nNote that if ServiceDllUnloadOnStop is 1, then the service DLL is assumed to use one or other of these techniques for each of its services. If it returns from ServiceMain without having registered a stop callback, then it is liable to get unloaded. ",

      "description": "The SecureDelete wiper used in the Shamoon 3 attacks was based on an open source tool called SecureDelete, in which the developer of the wiper used SuperDelete\u2019s source code and modified it to create a new wiper tool. Unlike the Disttrack wiper used in Shamoon 3, the SuperDelete variant does not rely on a kernel driver to wipe files on the system. Instead, the SuperDelete wiper overwrites user files with random data before deleting them, which makes recovery of the files difficult without available backups. \n\nShamoon's SecureDelete wiper relies on two supporting executables: a Loader Trojan and the Spreader Trojan. The Loader and Spreader would likely be loaded on one compromised system on the network and used as a centralized point to distribute the wiper to remote systems.",

      "description": "Shuabang techniques, or BlackASO (Black Hat App Store Optimization). This is a real industry in China that has been active for years. The method consists in creating an infrastructure to score or artificially inflate the number of downloads of an app so they rise up their position on the markets. This infrastructure requires fundamentally Google or iOS accounts so they can distort actions, as if they were generated by real users. This \"service\" is usually sold to a third party intermediary (companies) that claim to enhance and optimize positions in any market but they do not really care about the methods to achieve it.\n\nTo carry out the fraudulent scheme, the attacker needs active Google accounts associated with real devices that do not appear suspicious to Google, which would quickly eliminate them otherwise. Different techniques are used for this purpose. The most usual is to manually hire users that will create accounts in the market and rate apps they are told to. On this particular occasion, they came up with a system that starting from a set of fake Google accounts, distributes and associates them to different devices, so they take full advantage of the number of phones associated with an account. Besides, it allows sending tasks to the device so it simulates downloading apps under fake accounts. The potential of these malicious apps spotted for Shuabang is above average, since it demonstrates in-depth knowledge of the specific operation of Google's authentication protocols. Before getting into the details, let's see how Google accounts work.",

Hiding its designating icon from the app launcher and running in the background, it quietly intercepts and copies your valuable information.\nAs the name suggests, this app specifically uses text messages for its nefarious means through the following methods:\nSpam messaging: this causes the infected phone to send text messages containing malicious links to people in the infected device\u2019s contact list. When the receiver of the messages clicks on said link, the attacker is paid either through call fraud or deals with (occasionally) innocent affiliates.\nPremium SMS fraud: an attacker will secretly send text messages to premium numbers they have purchased through the infected mobile device, leaving the phone\u2019s owner footing the bill. This trick can also be used by making calls to premium-rate phone numbers. Read more about it in this recent blog.\n",

      "description": "Operation Sphinx is a cyber-espionage activity in the Middle East. The main victims are political and military organizations in Egypt, Israel and possibly other countries. Sensitive data theft is what the attackers plotted for during the period from June, 2014 to November, 2015 when the activity was in its prime. We encountered some timestamps of the samples to be as early as December, 2011 which suggests the attack might be started much earlier, though further soundproof is needed. The main approach of Sphinx is watering hole attack on social websites. \n\nSphinx utilized both Windows and Android malware.",

It took some time before we could understand Stantinko\u2019s purpose because of the way it stays persistent while not leaving too much\ninformation on the compromised machine. To get a global view of the Stantinko ecosystem, you need a lot of the pieces of the puzzle. The more we dug and tracked Stantinko, the more\n we could collect those pieces and put them together.\nThe scale of the botnet also caught our attention. With a victim population of hundreds of thousands, Stantinko is one of the most prevalent threats in Russia.\nHere are some of the key findings from our research:\n\u2022 Installation statistics show that about half a million computers are compromised with Stantinko.\n\u2022 This threat targets mainly Russia (46%) and Ukraine (33%).\n\u2022 The botnet is monetized by installing browser extensions that inject ads while surfing the web.\n\u2022 Components that are left on disk employ a custom code obfuscator that mangles strings and applies control flow flattening.\n\u2022 In most of the Stantinko components, the malicious code is concealed inside legitimate free and open source software that has been modified and recompiled.\n\u2022 Stantinko installs multiple persistent services that install one another to resist cleaning attempts.\n\u2022 Although its most common use is to install adware, Stantinko can actually download and execute anything. We saw additional modules being deployed on subsets of the botnet\nsuch as a fully-featured remote administration backdoor, a bot performing searches on Google and a tool that brute-forces Joomla and WordPress administrative login pages.",

In particular, the focus was on Italian and Belgian users, but the StrongPity watering holes affected systems in far more locations than just those two. Adding in their creative waterholing and poisoned installer tactics, we describe the StrongPity APT as not only determined and well-resourced, but fairly reckless and innovative as well.",

Among other items, staff training documents and more than 40,000 emails were stored  on the machine and thought to be harvested by the attacker. The Japanese Atomic  Energy Agency is investigating further. \n\nThe attack appears to have been the result of the attackers having compromised the  \u2018GOM Player\u2019 update server and having it act as a \u2018watering hole\u2019, meaning that  machines which access the site are delivered malware.  Gom Player originates in South \n Korea and in some parts of Asia it is a popular alternative to Windows Media Player. It is  unclear whether every machine trying to download an update received this malware or whether only machines which fitted a certain profile were infected. \n\nTechnical analysis of the implant on the compromised machine has shown it to be a variant of a Trojan which has been in the wild for some years now and continues to be effective.

One is CVE-2012-1856, reinvigorated with a novel ROP chain to bypass ASLR and deliver the uWarrior payload. The other appears to be CVE-2015-1770. The malware itself is a fully featured RAT, which uses a compressed, (optionally) encrypted, raw TCP socket and binary message protocol for command and control communications.\nDuring the course of our research, it became evident that this actor had not built uWarrior from scratch, but rather opted to borrow components from several off-the-shelf tools. Linkages between older RATs are explored later in this blog.",

      "description": "Around July 2016, more than a 100 Israeli servicemen were hit by a cunning threat actor. The attack compromised their devices and exfiltrated data to the attackers\u2019 command and control server. In addition, the compromised devices were pushed Trojan updates, which allowed the attackers to extend their capabilities. The operation remains active at the time of writing this post, with attacks reported as recently as February 2017.\n\nThe campaign, which experts believe is still in its early stages, targets Android OS devices. Once the device is compromised, a process of sophisticated intelligence gathering starts, exploiting the ability to access the phone\u2019s video and audio capabilities, SMS functions and location.\n\nThe campaign relies heavily on social engineering techniques, leveraging social networks to lure targeted soldiers into both sharing confidential information and downloading the malicious applications.\n\nCharacterized by relatively unsophisticated technical merit, and extensive use of social engineering, the threat actor targets only IDF soldiers.",

This campaign, led by a persistent attacker group, has successfully penetrated a large number of targets\nusing various attack techniques, and specifically, a custom-made malware implant codenamed Explosive. \n\nVolatile Cedar is heavily based on a custom-made remote access Trojan named Explosive, which is implanted within its targets and\nthen used to harvest information. Tracking down these infections was quite a difficult task due to the multiple concealment measures\ntaken by the attackers. The attackers select only a handful of targets to avoid unnecessary exposure. New and custom versions are\ndeveloped, compiled and deployed specifically for certain targets, and \u201dradio silence\u201d periods are configured and embedded specifically\ninto each targeted implant.",
